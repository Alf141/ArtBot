Hello, everyone! I've set up a pi that I'll keep running as our dev server
In a few days from writeing, DNS should have updated, and you can "ssh <username>@ssh.cogarr.org" till then, just use my ip "ssh <username>@67.163.166.94"
There's no way so see what anything will look like on-screen, I'll take a look to see if I can't set something up tomarrow.

Stuff - 
Mostly generic linux machine
There's a special directory under /home/artbot/ that's linked with git, work on your changes locally, push them to github, then log into the server, pull, and run whatever you want to test
There is a second special directory under /home/shared/, please document whatever you install/change permenantly to log.txt with your name and the date
You all are sudoers, don't sudo anything unless you know you won't break stuff
Please ONLY ONLY ONLY "sudo pacman -Syu" on friday afternoons when I'm avaliable to restart the server in case everything breaks
The SQL server is MariaDB, arch's version of Oracle's MySQL
Both python2.x and python3.x are installed, "python" symlinks to python3 by default but don't always expect it to, so be sure to specify #/usr/bin/python2 or #/usr/bin/python3 in your shebang line
I'm fairly certain I'm missing some people, but anyone can add a user with "sudo adduser -m -s /bin/zsh <username>","echo '<username>' | sha512sum | tail -c 10" to get the password, and "passwd <username>", then the password twice.
Don't forget to add them to the sudoers with "visudo"
Feel free to change your own password with "passwd"

Users are listed below
Username		Password
alex			76cc21
erin			12c7cd
joe			d1cca4
john			1fcf86
michelle		67adfb

I'm running Fail2Ban, if you get your password wrong 6 times while trying to ssh in, your account gets locked down.
Other stuff- I'm fairly certain I'll be useing remote headless X server to test what things would look like on a touch display, if you're on windows, that means you'll need to download and install CigWin, with the Xorg packages
